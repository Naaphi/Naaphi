ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Umair Murtaza.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in University Projects, especially those related to software development and C#.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and honing my skills in C# to become a proficient software developer.

ðŸ’¼ I have experience in the following areas:
   - Java & C# Programming
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Software Development
   - Web Development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

ðŸ’¡ I'm eager to collaborate on university projects that involve C# or any exciting software development challenges.
